# International October Code Jam 2021 by Yandex Practicum 100.

The **International October Practicum Code Jam** aims to draw participants' attention to the challenges we face in a new reality and jointly come up with digital solutions to address them. Over the past 1,5 years, our daily lives have been profoundly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The first shock of the crisis has passed but we are still adapting.

The challenge is to create an MVP of a digital service that we can benefit from as lockdowns,  travel regulations, changing workplace habits, and health precautions are still affecting our lives.

The Code Jam unites Web Development students from Practicum 100 programs in the US and Israel with UX/UI Design students from Russia - teams of two Web Development students from US and Israel, and UX/UI Design student from Russia collaborate during the Code Jam.
